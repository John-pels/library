How to Setup & Read/Publish EPUB Books
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BiB/i supports 3 ways to read/publish EPUB books:

* Read in browsers on your local machine.
* Publish on the web to have your books read by someone.
* Open to the public as an online EPUB viewer for visitors' local EPUBs.

In all cases,

1. Download BiB/i from [GitHub release page](https://github.com/satorumurmur/bibi/releases) or [BiB/i website](https://bibi.epub.link/#download).
2. And unzip it at first.



### Read in browsers on your local machine 

1. Open `bib/i/index.html` in your browser, and
2. Drag an EPUB book and drop it into the window.
3. That's all!



### Publish on the web

[Demo](https://bibi.epub.link/#demo).

You can publish both unzipped folder and zipped EPUB archive.

Using unzipped folder is recommended for the book which is heavy or contains many files.
Using zipped EPUB file is recommended for the book which is light or contains less files.



#### Publish unzipped folders

1. Upload `bib` folder on your web server.
2. Unzip an EPUB book,
    1. Change the file extension from `.epub` to `.zip` (`BOOKNAME.epub` -> `BOOKNAME.zip`), and
    2. Unzip the file with some tool.
3. Upload the unzipped folder `BOOKNAME` into `bib/bookshelf` directory, and
4. Access to `https://your.web.site/somewhere/bib/i/?book=BOOKNAME` by your browser. (note that it has no extension)
5. Or embed code below into your blog entry or other webpages, and visit the entry.

````
<a href="https://your.web.site/somewhere/bib/i/?book=BOOKNAME" data-bibi="embed" data-bibi-style="[[ CSS for embeded BiB/i frame, as you like ]]">My Great Book Title</a><script src="https://your.web.site/bib/i.js"></script>
````


#### Publish zipped EPUB files

1. Upload `bib` folder on your web server.
2. Upload your EPUB book (ex. `BOOKNAME.epub`) to `bib/bookshelf` directory, and
3. Access to `https://your.web.site/somewhere/bib/i/?book=BOOKNAME.epub` by your browser.
4. Or embed code for it.

````
<a href="https://your.web.site/somewhere/bib/i/?book=BOOKNAME.epub" data-bibi="embed" data-bibi-style="[[ CSS for embeded BiB/i frame, as you like ]]">My Great Book Title</a><script src="https://your.web.site/bib/i.js"></script>
````


#### Open to the public as an online EPUB viewer for visitors' local EPUBs

1. Upload `bib` folder on your web server.
2. Navigate visitors to `https://your.web.site/somewhere/bib/i`.
3. Visitors can read one's local EPUBs by draging and dropping EPUBs into the window.

If you want to terminate this feature, set "no" to "accept-files" in `bib/i/presets/default.js`.
